legend: Question 2 of 3
---
You and a friend are working together to collect trainig data for the same model. The model will recognise whether a person is wearing a red or blue hat. Which of these is the best approach to use to collect your data?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Record yourselves seperately, with one of you wearing the red hat and the other wearing the blue hat

  --- feedback ---
  Because you are using different people, locations, and hats, the model will not know which difference it is supposed to be learning to recognise.
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Record yourselves in the same location, with each of you wearing both the red and blue hats in different photographs

  --- feedback ---
  This will create a model that can tell the difference between the red and blue hat successfully, but it may be using the shapes of those specific hats, and it may get confused if shown a photograph taken in a different location
  --- /feedback ---

- ( ) Record yourselves in several different locations, with each of you wearing both the red and blue hats in different photographs

  --- feedback ---
  This is very good, as the model will learn to recognise the hat colours in many different contexts. However, it will still only have seen the same two people and the same two hats, so there is a better choice.

- (x) Record yourselves, and other people, in several different locations, with each of you wearing a number of different red and blue hats in different photographs

  --- feedback ---
  This is the best option. The model won't learn anything specific to any person, location, or even style of hat. It will also learn to recongise the hat colour on different kinds of people. A model with this training data is the most likely to successfully classify any new photo it is shown.
