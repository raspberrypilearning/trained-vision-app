legend: Question 3 of 3
---
You have successfully recorded training data for your Teachable Machine model, and it has completed its training. How would you test if it works as you intended?

--- choices ---

- ( ) Check how many images you used to train it

  --- feedback ---
  While a large set of images does improve your models chances of training well, it doesn't guarantee it.

- (x) Use the model preview to test it in Teachable Machine

  --- feedback ---
  The model preview will let you hold examples of classes up to your computer's webcam and see what your model thinks they are. Doing this a few times, with examples of each class, will give you a good idea of how well the model is working.

- ( ) Read the exported code of your model

  --- feedback ---
  This code is for your Python application to read, and really wouldn't make much sense to a human.
