If you are training a model to tell when a person in a picture is smiling, and you use your webcam to quickly record 1000 images where you are smiling, and 1000 images where you are not, which of the following should you be worried about?

--- choices ---

- (x) The model having issues with people who aren't you

  --- feedback ---
  Because you have only used pictures of you, and only under the same conditions — location, lighting, clothing, etc. — the model may have issues with people who look different to you in terms of things like height, build, skin tone, how they smile, what they're wearing, where they are, etc.

- ( ) Computers not understanding the concept of a smile

  --- feedback ---
  While your model will not know what a smile is, it will be able to classify an image as being similar to those pictures it has been shown in the 'smile' class, or in the 'not smile' class.

- ( ) The number of images you have recorded

  --- feedback ---
   A larger number of training images is almost always better, but 1000 images should be more than enough to train this model.

- ( ) The model learning to recognise your clothes, instead of your smile

  --- feedback ---
  Unless you changed clothes between your smiling and not smiling photographs, the model will likely ignore your clothes, as they aren't different in the two classes it is learning to tell apart.
