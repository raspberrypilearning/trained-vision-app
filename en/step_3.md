You can create a model that will recognise whatever you want to teach it about. So you've got a lot of choices in what kind of classifers you can create! Think about that now and decide what sorts of things you might want to classify. A few ideas might be:

+ Different facial expressions
+ Different hand gestures
+ Different objects around the room
+ Animals
+ Cars
+ Sights around your area

Remember that you'll need to provide traing data for each of these classes of image, so don't pick too many or you'll never finish!
