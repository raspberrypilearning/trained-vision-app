## Get inspiration

You can create a model to recognise whatever you want, which means that you have a lot of choices in what kind of classifiers you can create! Think about that now and decide what  you might want to classify. Here are a few ideas to get you started:

+ Different facial expressions
+ Different hand gestures
+ Different objects around the room
+ Animals
+ Cars
+ Sights around your area

Remember that you need to provide training data for each of these classes of image. Make sure you don't pick too many or it may take you a very long time!
