## Introduction

Create your own machine vision model and Python application to identify a user's images.


### What you will make
You will combine a model you train using Google's Teachable Machine with a Python program you create on your computer, to build an application that can either:

 + Take a picture with a user's webcam and classify it, then share that classifcation with the user
 + Take an image file provided by the user, and classify it, then share that classifcation with the user

### What you will learn
You will learn:
 + To build and train a model with Teachable Machine
 + What to consider when providing training data to a model
 + How to connect a model with a Python program you've made

### What you should know
To do this project, you should be familiar with:
 + How to interact with a machine vision model, as covered in [Testing your computerâ€™s vision](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/testing-your-computers-vision)
 + How to create and use variables, lists, conditional statements, and functions in Python
